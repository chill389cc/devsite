# Dev Site
This is a simple site with a stupid name that I'll use to host various things

# Development:
1. Make your changes on a new branch
2. Make a PR to main
3. After PR is merged, check that docker hub deploy works
4. Wait for [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower) to pull down the new docker version, which happens every 60 seconds

# TODO
- Implement HTMX and use HTMX as a wrapper for base site stuff
- Show users their IP for fun
